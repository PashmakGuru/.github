# Fallback `.github`` Repository

The `.github` repository in Pashmak Guru serves a unique and essential role. It's a special repository that acts as a default source for community health files for all other repositories within our organization. This means if a specific repository in Pashmak Guru doesn't have its own `.github` directory with issue templates, contributing guidelines, or other community health files, it will automatically refer to the `.github` repository for these resources.

There is also a [profile/README.md](profile/README.md) which appears in the homepage of the GitHub organization.
