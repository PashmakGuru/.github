# Pashmak Guru: A Learning Journey in Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)

## Introduction to Pashmak Guru

Pashmak Guru is a GitHub organization where we, as a team of learners and enthusiasts, explore the principles of Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC). We use Terraform modules to build infrastructure on Microsoft Azure, to learn various topics and keep them here for people who are interested in learning too. This organization demonstrates how IaC can be applied, albeit not with the polish of a production-ready project.

## Our Approach

- **Practical Examples with Terraform and Azure:** We provide examples and experiments that we conduct in real-time, showcasing our learning journey in creating infrastructure on Azure.
- **Integration with Port Internal Developer Platform:** We use this platform as part of our learning to understand better how different tools work together.

## Who Is This For

- **Aspiring Cloud Enthusiasts:** Perfect for those who are starting their journey in cloud computing and want to learn alongside a team doing the same.
- **Students & Hobbyists:** If you're interested in exploring cloud infrastructure and IaC, our repositories offer real-time learning scenarios.
